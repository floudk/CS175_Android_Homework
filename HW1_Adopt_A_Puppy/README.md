## Two activities:
- One for **showing all puppies' simple intro**, including **Name**, **Age**, **Breed**, and a **Brief introdction**.

  There are only 8 items in the RecyclerView, which can be modified in *MainActivity.kt* if needed.  
  **Long Clicking the item** can enter into the detailed activity, and related information will be transferred through **intent**.   
  
- Another for showing **much more details** for a puppy after clicking the former activity, including **Source** and some **Notice** that potential adopters need to pay attention to.

  Since writing information is neither a easy work nor our focus, all pages are displaying the same text description.
